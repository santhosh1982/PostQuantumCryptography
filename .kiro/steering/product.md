# Product Overview

## PQC Secure Chat Application

A quantum-safe messaging application that implements post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for secure peer-to-peer communication. The application provides encrypted text and image messaging using ML-KEM-768 (Kyber) for key encapsulation and ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium) for digital signatures.

### Key Features
- Real-time encrypted messaging with WebSocket connections
- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
- Secure image sharing with encryption
- Peer-to-peer key exchange and verification
- Connection status and encryption indicators
- Dark/light mode support

### Target Users
Security-conscious users, developers, and organizations requiring quantum-resistant communication channels.

### Security Focus
The application prioritizes cryptographic security and transparency, with prominent encryption status indicators and technical details accessible to users who need them.
