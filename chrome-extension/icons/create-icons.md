# Icon Creation Instructions

Create the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines:
- Use the PQC theme colors: #60a5fa (blue) and #10b981 (green)
- Include quantum/security elements (shield, lock, quantum symbols)
- Maintain consistency with the chat application design
- Ensure visibility on both light and dark backgrounds

## Suggested Design:
- Base: Dark background (#0a0a0a or transparent)
- Primary element: Stylized shield or lock icon in #60a5fa
- Accent: Small quantum dots or network lines in #10b981
- Typography: "PQC" text for larger sizes (48px, 128px)

## Tools:
- Use any vector graphics editor (Figma, Sketch, Illustrator)
- Or create simple PNG files with any image editor
- Ensure crisp edges and proper anti-aliasing

## Temporary Solution:
For testing, you can use simple colored squares or download free icons from:
- Heroicons (https://heroicons.com/)
- Lucide (https://lucide.dev/)
- Feather Icons (https://feathericons.com/)

Just ensure they're the correct sizes and saved as PNG files.
